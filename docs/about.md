# About this project

I have created this project as a part of the selection process for the position of Web Development Intern at EntHire.

I have used vuepress plugin to create the documentation pages. Vuepress has the inbuilt functionality of converting the folder structure having markdown(.md) files into a fully designed documentation pages.

To make the task easy for the admin to add new md files, I have also created a utility using express.js which can be used as an in-house product.
