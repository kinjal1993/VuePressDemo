# Website Documentation using VuePress

## About the project

I have created documentation website using [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) framework. I have used the default theme provided by **VuePress**. To make modifications in the theme I have used the **Theme Inheritance** feature provided **VuePress**. I have also created a library to load contents of sidebar dynamically.

To make easy to add a new markdown file I have created a utility using **Express**. So the admin doesn't have dive into the project structure to add new `.md` files. You can add markup content from there into the docs/ folder of the project. I have integrated [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) plugin to show the preview of markups. The utility is just for the development purpose so i haven't deployed it on the production server.
