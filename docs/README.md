# Website Documentation using VuePress

## About the project

This is a documentation website created using [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) framework and used the default theme provided by **VuePress**. To make modifications in the theme, **Theme Inheritance** feature is used. The project contains a library to load contents of sidebar dynamically.

To make easy to add a new markdown file there is a utility created using **Express**. So the admin doesn't have to dive into the project structure to add new `.md` files. You can add markup content from there into the docs/ folder of the project. [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) plugin is integrated to show the preview of markups. The utility is just for the development purpose so it is not deployed it on the production server.
