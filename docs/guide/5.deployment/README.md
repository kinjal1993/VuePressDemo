# Deployment on Netlify
I have used Netlify for the deployment process. Here are the steps for deployment.

On [Netlify](https://netlify.com), setup up a new project from GitHub with the following settings:
1. **Build Command**: `npm run docs:build`
2. **Publish directory**: `docs/.vuepress/dist`
3. Hit the deploy button.

## Here's the Netlify link for this project
