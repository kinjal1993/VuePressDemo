# Quick Start

## 1. Clone the git project
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/kinjal1993/VuePressDemo.git
``` 
## 2. Navigate to the folder
``` bash
cd <folder-name>
``` 
## 3. Install dependencies
``` bash
npm install
```

The project is divided into two parts:

**1. docs**

It contains all the markup files and .vuepress folder. All the contents in sidebar are loaded from `docs/guide/` dynamically so that no need to modify `config.js` each time a new `.md` file is added.

## While Development
``` bash
cd docs
vuepress dev
```

## Production build
``` bash
cd docs
vuepress build
```

**2. add-markup**

It is a utility built using `express.js` to make easy for the admin to add new markup files to `docs/guide` folder.

``` bash
npm start
```

Using this utility you can add new `.md` files into `docs/guide/`. [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) plugin is integrated to show the preview of markups.

> This is just a utility to make the process of adding new markup files easier. One can opt to add `.md` manually as well and documentation will get generated as it is.
