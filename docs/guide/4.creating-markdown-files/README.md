# Creating Markdown Files Dynamically

A utility is created using **Express** to make easy to add a new markdown file. So the admin doesn't have dive into the project structure to add new `.md` files. You can add markup content from there into the docs/ folder of the project. [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) plugin is integrated to show the preview of markups.
