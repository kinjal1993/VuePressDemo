# Creating Markdown Files Dynamically

To make easy to add a new markdown file I have created a utility using **Express**. So the admin doesn't have dive into the project structure to add new `.md` files. You can add markup content from there into the docs/ folder of the project. I have integrated [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) plugin to show the preview of markups.
