## Introduction

I have created documentation website using [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) framework. I have used the default theme provided by **VuePress**. To make modifications in the theme I have used the **Theme Inheritance** feature provided **VuePress**. I have also created a library to load contents of sidebar dynamically.

# Why VuePress

1. VuePress sites load fast. Search engines and users both like this.
2. The default theme is by definition very well suited to presenting technical information because it was designed for the Vue.js site. It looks good out of the box and is easy to modify thanks to its use of Stylus.
3. A VuePress site is just a bunch of Markdown files. Markdown is nothing more than text formatted a certain way, and saved in a file ending with the extension `md`.
