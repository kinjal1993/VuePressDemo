## Introduction

I have created documentation website using [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) framework. I have used the default theme provided by **VuePress**. To make modifications in the theme I have used the **Theme Inheritance** feature provided **VuePress**. I have also created a library to load contents of sidebar dynamically.

I have prepared documentation of this project only with the use of **VuePress**. The project mainly demonstrate the use of **VuePress** plugin to create website documentation more efficiently and quickly. Additionally I have added the functionality of dynamically adding `.md` files into **docs/** using `express.js`.
